  ## About the Project

<h3> User Store:</h3>
<br>
<p>AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals 
and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling </p>

<br>
<h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection 
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have 
added an expense or deposit
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are 
added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
